        This package provides a simple Python extension module ``sass`` which is
        binding Libsass_ (written in C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung).
        It's very straightforward and there isn't any headache related Python
        distribution/deployment.  That means you can add just ``libsass`` into
        your ``setup.py``'s ``install_requires`` list or ``requirements.txt`` file.
        Need no Ruby nor Node.js.
        
        It currently supports CPython 2.7, 3.3--3.5, and PyPy 2.3+!

        Features
        --------
        
        - You don't need any Ruby/Node.js stack at all, for development or deployment
          either.
        - Fast. (Libsass_ is written in C++.)
        - Simple API.  See the below example code for details.
        - Custom functions.
        - ``@import`` callbacks.
        - Support both tabbed (Sass) and braces (SCSS) syntax.
        - WSGI middleware for ease of development.
          It automatically compiles Sass/SCSS files for each request.
        - ``setuptools``/``distutils`` integration.
          You can build all Sass/SCSS files using
          ``setup.py build_sass`` command.
        - Works also on PyPy.
        - Provides prebuilt wheel_ binaries for Windows and Mac.

        Install
        -------
        
        It's available on PyPI_, so you can install it using ``pip`` (or
        ``easy_install``):
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install libsass
        
        .. note::
        
           libsass requires some features introduced by the recent C++ standard.
           You need a C++ compiler that support those features.
           See also libsass project's README_ file.

        .. _example:
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
           >>> import sass
           >>> print sass.compile(string='a { b { color: blue; } }')
           a b {
             color: blue; }
        
        
        Docs
        ----
        
        There's the user guide manual and the full API reference for ``libsass``:
        
        http://hongminhee.org/libsass-python/
        
        You can build the docs by yourself:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ cd docs/
           $ make html
        
        The built docs will go to ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.
